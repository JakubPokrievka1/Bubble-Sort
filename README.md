This code is meant to be my first implementation of a bubble sort algorithm.
It is meant for me to be as a first time look on how I can write up a algorithm for me to sort through a list of randomly generated array of numbers.
To run the script on Linux, the easiest way to do it is via a terminal using "./bubble_sort.py" after giving permissions to the file using "chmod +x bubble_sort.py".
On Windows/MacOS, it is best ran via a IDE.
